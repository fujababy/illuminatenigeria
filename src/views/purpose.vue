      <h3>
        Ensure Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Renewable Modern Energy for All
      </h3>
      <p>
        There is no development without fuelling the engine of growth. Energy is critical and people
        with no sustainable access to energy are deprived of the opportunity to become part of
        national and global progress. And yet, 86 million people around the country live without
        access to energy. 39% of the country's population, do not have access to electricity.
        Nigeria is supposed to be a significant contributor to the rise in global energy demand.

        It is hard to believe that 86 million people in Nigeria donâ€™t have access to energy. Energy
        is not just a convenient resource; energy powers lives and creates opportunities. It allows
        communities to thrive and economies to grow. It powers imagination and allows people to
        realize their dreams. And with clean energy, the country thrives as well.

        By working with communities and businesses Illuminate Nigeria delivers affordable clean
        energy solutions to those who need it most. Solar energy enables children to study at night.
        Farmers can irrigate their fields and process crops to increase yields. In remote areas,
        doctors can treat patients and deliver life-saving vaccines. Mothers can give birth safely
        at night. Entrepreneurs can start and grow businesses.
